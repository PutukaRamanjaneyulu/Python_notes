Python Basics Summary

1️⃣ Data Types: Python has various built-in data types, including:

- Numeric: int, float, complex

- Sequence: str, list, tuple

- Set & Mapping: set, frozenset, dict

- Boolean: bool (True/False

- NoneType: None

2️⃣ Type Conversion:

- Implicit Conversion: Python automatically converts smaller types to larger ones (e.g., int → float).

- Explicit Conversion: Using functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), etc.

3️⃣ String Built-in Functions:

- Case Changes: upper(), lower(), capitalize(), title(), swapcase()

- Search & Check: startswith(), endswith(), find()

- Modification: replace(), strip(), split(), join()

- Formatting: f-strings for dynamic string formatting

## List Python_file.ipynb
##### Key Insights
-> The notebook begins by explaining that lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed.

-> It attempts to assign a value to an index beyond the current list size, which leads to an IndexError.

-> It likely covers list indexing, slicing, adding, removing, and modifying elements.

-> There might be some examples demonstrating list methods (e.g., append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), etc.).

-> Some cells may include incorrect operations to illustrate errors or limitations.

#  Tuple.ipynb
* The notebook covers Python Tuples, including their properties, built-in functions, and advantages. Key topics include:

## 1.Introduction to Tuples

-> Tuples are represented with () and can store any data type.

-> They are immutable, meaning their memory allocation cannot be increased or decreased.
## 2.Memory Behavior

-> Code snippets demonstrate that trying to modify tuple elements results in an error.

-> Deleting a tuple completely removes it from memory.

## 3.Built-in Functions

-> count(): Counts occurrences of a value in a tuple.

-> index(): Finds the index of a given value.

## 4.Advantages of Tuples

-> Tuples allow multiple values to be stored in a single variable.

-> Packing and unpacking of tuple values is useful for variable assignment.
