Python Basics Summary

1️⃣ Data Types: Python has various built-in data types, including:

- Numeric: int, float, complex

- Sequence: str, list, tuple

- Set & Mapping: set, frozenset, dict

- Boolean: bool (True/False

- NoneType: None

2️⃣ Type Conversion:

- Implicit Conversion: Python automatically converts smaller types to larger ones (e.g., int → float).

- Explicit Conversion: Using functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), etc.

3️⃣ String Built-in Functions:

- Case Changes: upper(), lower(), capitalize(), title(), swapcase()

- Search & Check: startswith(), endswith(), find()

- Modification: replace(), strip(), split(), join()

- Formatting: f-strings for dynamic string formatting

## List Python_file
##### Key Insights
-> The notebook begins by explaining that lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed.

-> It attempts to assign a value to an index beyond the current list size, which leads to an IndexError.

-> It likely covers list indexing, slicing, adding, removing, and modifying elements.

-> There might be some examples demonstrating list methods (e.g., append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), etc.).

-> Some cells may include incorrect operations to illustrate errors or limitations.
